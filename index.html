          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if
          not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years
          before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing
          experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
          thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
          successfully
          switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
          of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
          disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
          particular, was
          outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me
          land
          a job
          as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
